      <description>•	Implement a tool that classifies whether a lung is affected by pneumonia due to covid-19
•	Images are collected from different resources such as hospital, medical center etc and jupyter and python are used to load the images
•	Features of images are preprocessed, standardized and normalized.
•	Tensor flow is used to build CNN model to predict the output
•	This model is used in app and web.</description>

      <description>•Implement a tool that can classify different species of wheat based on certain attributes.
•A dataset is prepared based on survey and dataset is loaded and read using python on Jupiter platform.
•K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine are used to train the model and select the best fir model.
•Finally, import the model into apps or webs.

      <description>• Create a tool that predicts whether a company retains its customer or churns its customer so that company can change its business policy.
• Customer details are fetched and loaded to the system using python and jupyter.
• Features from the text of each customer description classify the customer orientation.
• Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector are used and compare the performance of each model and finally select the best fit model.</description>
